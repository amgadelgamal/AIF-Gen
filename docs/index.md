# AIF-GEN Documentation

## Installing from source:

### Prerequisites

AIF-GEN uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage and lock project dependencies for a consistent and reproducible environment.
If you do not have `uv` installed on your system, visit [this page](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for installation instructions.

**Note**: If you have `pip` installed globally you can just invoke:

```sh
pip install uv
```

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ComplexData-MILA/AIF-Gen.git
cd AIF-Gen
uv sync
```
